# rpi-telegram-bot

I'm going to build a fully functional telegram bot for raspberry pi 5 (rpi) with features,  

  1. Temperature Checking  
  2. System Monitoring  
  3. Command rpi 
	And more features will be added.

Here I'm using ssh to connect rpi to my computer since I don't have proper Display for rpi.
